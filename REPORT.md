# AgriQuest: Technical Specification & Impact Report (v2.4)

## I. Executive Summary
AgriQuest is a specialized Neural Operating System (OS) for Agriculture designed to bridge the intelligence gap between smallholder farmers and modern agronomic science. The platform utilizes multimodal AI (Google Gemini) to transform mobile devices into sophisticated diagnostic suites, enabling precise, sustainable, and transparent farming practices.

## II. The Core Sustainability Mission
Traditional farming relies on "Excessive Blanket Application"—applying chemicals uniformly across fields. AgriQuest implements **Precision Variable Rate Prescription (VRP)** to reduce chemical reliance by:
1.  **Chemical Reduction Logic**: Using AI to analyze leaf spectral data, the system identifies exact nutrient requirements, typically resulting in a **30-40% reduction in nitrogen fertilizer waste**.
2.  **Weather-Fused Protocol**: Integrating 7-day weather logic. If rain is predicted, the AI automatically suggests a "Split-Dose" to prevent chemical leaching into local groundwater.
3.  **Sustainable Impact Index**: Tracking how many kilograms of unnecessary chemicals were *saved* by following AI advice, providing farmers with a "Sustainability Score" that increases their harvest value.

## III. Neural Architecture (Google Gemini Integration)

### 1. Vision Layer (Gemini-3-Flash-Preview)
*   **Pathogen Recognition**: Convolutional neural patterns are used to identify visual markers of fungal, bacterial, and viral infections.
*   **Spectral Simulation**: Moving beyond standard RGB, the system uses Gemini to interpolate NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Thermal stress markers.
*   **Livestock Biometrics**: 2D-to-3D mesh reconstruction is simulated to extract body length, height, and girth for objective health grading.

### 2. Reasoning Layer (Gemini-3-Pro-Preview)
*   **Agronomic Synthesis**: Fusing soil health data with crop variety patterns and market demand.
*   **Thinking Mode**: Utilizing the `thinkingBudget` (16,000 tokens) to analyze complex pest outbreak patterns and historical yield correlations.

### 3. Voice Layer (Gemini-2.5-Flash-Native-Audio)
*   **Multilingual Support**: Low-latency, real-time voice interaction for hands-free troubleshooting in rural dialects.
*   **Tone Detection**: Understanding the urgency in a farmer's voice to prioritize critical pest alerts.

---

## IV. The "Streek" (Streak) & Engagement Logic
To ensure long-term sustainability, AgriQuest gamifies compliance via the **Neural Streak Protocol**:
*   **Daily Field Audit**: Farmers must scan at least one crop node daily or verify IoT sensor readings.
*   **Milestone Rewards**: Sustaining a 7-day streak unlocks "Premium Market Intelligence" and increases visibility to buyers.
*   **Digital Twin Sync**: A high streak indicates a "High-Sync" state where the digital model of the farm is perfectly aligned with real-world conditions.

---

## V. Decentralized supply Chain (Blockchain)
*   **Smart Minting**: Every harvest is minted as a "Verified Batch" on a simulated ledger.
*   **Seed-to-Shelf Traceability**: Consumers can scan a QR code to view the entire audit log—from sowing date to the exact amount of fertilizer saved.
*   **Oracle Verification**: IoT sensors act as hardware oracles, feeding cold-chain temperature and humidity data directly into the immutable record.
